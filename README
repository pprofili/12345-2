A handy utility to pop up an xlogo as the decimal seconds 
since epoch aligns itself with 1234567890

This utility should probably be called 123456780meter or something but I got tired of typing when inputting the project name.

1233999731: 2009-02-07  1 01:42:11
1233999744: 2009-02-07  1 01:42:24

Originally challenged myself to write this when it occurred to me
in the last 250 or so seconds there, but I did fail to do that -
although I blame the whiskey.

1234567890-1234116252

451638 / 60 / 60 / 24

This utility has approximately 5 days' use so download it quick.
